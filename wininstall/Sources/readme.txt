Remarks to the sources
======================

Sources in this directory have been written in pure ANSI-C with the freely available comiler
lcc (http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~lcc-win32/)

The system tray utility freenet.exe has been written in Assembler using the free MASM32, see
the readme in that directory for more information about it. (Using the FREE MASM assembler given away by Microsoft!)

The FindJava utility has been written using Microsoft Visual C++, I haven't gotten it to compile with e.g. the free Blodsheet Dev-C++ (http://www.bloodshed.net/), that might be a nice
small task for a C++ guy.
