How to prepare a self installing package of "Freenet for Windows"
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Any questions? mailto:Sebastian@SSpaeth.de / mailto:freenet@hug.cx

How to make an install
======================
1)Get the free Nullsoft installer (NSIS) at http://nullsoft.com/free/NSIS (>v1.1h)
  or from http://firehose.net/free/nsis
2a)Add the current binaries to the "Freenet" subdirectory:
  frenet.exe,fserve.exe,NodeConfig.exe,cfgclient.exe,findjava.exe,GetSeed.exe
  (the sources are in the Sources subdirectory, binaries are not included due to Oskars protest anymore)
  freenet.jar
  (freenet.ini will be created on install)
2b)Add upx.exe to this directory (for additional compression of the installer) 
   from http://upx.sourceforge.net/ (but it will work without as well)
   
4)Configure freenet.nsi to contain the correct version numbers and exe name on all appearances
5)Call "makensis freenet0.4.x.nsi" or right-click and "compile" the script if you installed NSIS correctly
6)Test install AND LET OTHER PEOPLE INSTALL AS WELL, bugs often appear only with special 
  configurations (Java Runtime, Win version, Path names,...)


ToDo list (Help appreciated)
============================
Browser plugins:
IEplugin:
 - Test if automatic install works!
Mozilla plugin:
 - Either include browser plugins in the install or pop up a text file, telling how to
   install them
 - Add instructions about how to change the port number.
 - problem with long temp filenames?

Java source:
 - Make scripts.Setup.java so that it can silently create a freenet.ini with all defaults

Cfgclient:
 - on multiple runs it appends the node port several times to .fproxyrc , preventing FProxy
   to start up (already fixed?)

FindJava.exe:
 - Rename Cancel button to "Abort" (best to cancel whole installation if possible!)
 - Put the window in Front once it is pops up the search done alert.

Bugs & improvements:
 - Configure doesn't work with jview.exe but with javaw.exe
 - Portcfg recognizes and respects used Freenet ports. However as we currently copy a new
   freenet.ini on every install over the old one, we lose the old prefs when installing a new
   version over the old one. (One more reason for letting scripts.Setup create a freenet.ini
   silently on install (it respects existing ports on creation as well).
 - turn off bandwidth throttling by default?
 - Write a better help file / manual / starter in a nice format (Windows help or html)
