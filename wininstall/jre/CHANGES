              Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition
                            Version 1.3.0_02

				CHANGES
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This software is an update release of the new Java(TM) 2 Platform, 
Standard Edition, (J2SE(TM)) version 1.3.0.  J2SE 1.3.0_01 contained
the following new enhancements for the Java Plug-in, that, among 
other enhancements, will enable the Java Plug-in for Netscape 6. 
Netscape 6, with Open JVM Integration (OJI), allows any JVM to be 
used in conjunction with the browser. 

Sun's Java Plug-in enhancements are designed to work with OJI to 
provide full applet support in Netscape 6 and to facilitate applet 
migration from Netscape 4.x browsers to Netscape 6. 

JAVA PLUG-IN ENHANCEMENTS
-------------------------

Unified Error and Warning Dialogs

  Based on com.sun.plugin.usability.DialogFactory, all error and 
  warning messages will be displayed in a dialog box with a unified 
  look and feel. 

  This will aid debugging of applets running in Netscape 6 via the 
  Open JVM Interface (OJI). 

Enhanced Error Reporting

  Much more information about error conditions will be reported in 
  this release. Previously, most errors faiedl silently, which made 
  debugging difficult. As above, this will aid in applet debugging.

Enhanced Java Plug-in Exception Reporting

  Previously the Java Console had to be open to view a stack trace when 
  exceptions occur. In this release, exceptions will be shown in a dialog 
  box when the Java Console is not open. This feature may be disabled. 
  As above, this will aid in applet debugging.

Enhanced Java Plug-in Tracing

  A Java Plug-in trace option (javaplugin.trace.option) will allow for 
  fine-grained control of tracing. Previously there was no option when 
  javaplugin.trace is turned on and messages can flood the Java Console. 
  As above, this will aid in applet debugging.

Java Console Enhancement

  Java Console has been converted to use Swing GUI components, allowing 
  unlimited message display; more debugging support (Run finalizers, 
  Trigger garbage collection, Display memory usage ...) have been added; 
  and an icon has been added to the Windows taskbar allowing the Java 
  Console to be displayed at any time. As above, this will aid in applet 
  debugging.

Enhanced Applet Progress Reporting

  Previously, applet status reporting was minimal in the applet (gray) 
  box; this enhancement will provide much more detail about what is 
  happening (init() method being called, JAR downloading, HTML 
  caching ...). As above, this will aid in applet debugging. 

True Modal Dialog Support 

  Modal dialogs to not work correctly in the original J2SE 1.3.0 release. 
  This release will fix it.

Delete Option for Cached Java Plug-in Files

  This option allows users to delete cached JAR and HTML files in 
  the Java Plug-in.


OJI FEATURES
------------

APPLET, EMBED AND OBJECT Tag Support in OJI

  OJI provides support so that applets using these tags will launch 
  the Java Plug-in.

Java-JavaScript Bi-directional Communication

  This allows JavaScript access to the methods of applets, and it 
  will allow Java full access to the Document Object Model (DOM) 
  through JavaScript.

Caching Option

  So that Java Plug-in may perform its own caching, browser caching 
  of Plug-in may be disabled.

Enable/Disable of Java Console

  OJI allows enabling/disabling of the Java Console through the 
  Netscape 6 browser menu.

Enable/Disable Java

  OJI allows enabling/disabling Java through the Netscape 6 
  browser menu.

Applet Lifecycle Change

  The shutdown sequence for Java Plug-in in OJI has the option to stop() 
  and destroy() the Java Plug-in when leaving a page. Applied to applets, 
  this eliminates problems associated with applets running in the 
  background.

Proxy and Cookie Support

  Previously, Java Plug-in handled proxy and cookie support. OJI 
  moves support to the browser.

Automatic Download

  Via its SmartUpdate mechanism, Netscape 6 supports automatic
  download of Java Plug-in (JRE) if it is not present. 


BUG FIXES
---------

This release also contains fixes for the following bugs identified 
in the original J2SE 1.3.0 release. More details on each of these 
bugs can be found on the Java Developer Connection(SM) BugParade 
web site by searching for the bug ID number.
