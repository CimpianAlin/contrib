This is the TODO file for FCPtools.


This file's purpose is to provide a breakdown of important features/fixes that
can be implemented by any competent C programmer.  If why a particular feature
needs implementaion is left a mystery, it's because long winded explanations
are not meant for this TODO file, otherwise I'd call it the TODO+WHY file.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
*** ezFCPlib specific *** (In order of relative importance)

1. Implement signal handling proper for a pthreads application.  Specifically,
it should compile *and* run on Solaris.

2. Work fcpPutKeyFromFile.c away from the #WINDOWS specifics.
   (completed- joliveri)

3. Confirm socket code in _fcpSock.c functions when compiled on NT/Cygwin.

4. A function that accepts (char *) and returns a unique filename.  The man
page for mktemp(3) is a good example, minus the portability.
 
5. Confirm file open() functions are portable and whether or not streams
should take their place (fcpOpenKey.c, ...).

6. Consolidate _fcpUtil.c with other global 'FCPtools' related functions.

7. Clean up _fcpRecvResponse.c (syntax, indenting scheme).  See if there can be
any code sharing.

8. Determine the purpose of fcpMakeChkFromMem.c, fcpMakeChkFromFile.c.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
*** FCPtools generic ***

. Enhance command-line interface.  Add --version to all tools.

(to be completed)
