Basic Installation for Solaris
==============================

These are Solaris specific installation instructions.

Follow the instructions in INSTALL, substituting 'make' with 'gmake'.
Hopefully, everything else is the same.  Feedback from Solaris users
would be much appreciated.

As of this time (2002-07-18) the tools do not compile on Solaris; I
am in the process of obtaining a more reliable Solaris shell than
SF's.
