Build
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Just run `make'.

Installing The Client Proxy
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To use Anarcast, you must run `proxy'. It requires a current database of
Anarcast servers, which is downloaded by `sync'. `sync' should be installed as
a cron job, running daily. This should be as simple as running it once
manually with the inform server address specified, and then putting the `sync'
binary in /etc/cron.daily/.

Installing The Server
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

              **** UNRELIABLE SERVERS DAMAGE THE NETWORK ****

Servers should *only* be run on permanent internet connections with static IP
addresses. I suggest as a minimum a high-end DSL connection.

You should register with the inform server every day, by placing a simple
script containing "/foo/bar/register <inform server address>" into
/etc/cron.daily/.

Running `server' will start your Anarcast server. You may change the value of
the HOME environment variable in order to select a different location for your
data store (e. g., "HOME=/bigdisk/ ./server").
