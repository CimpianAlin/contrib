This file's purpose is to provide a breakdown of important features/fixes
that can be implemented by any competent C programmer.

+ means todo
= means done
- means the feature was dropped

----------------
FCPtools generic

++ Problems at end of Put() routine for all files on Win32.
+ Update ezFCPlib documentation.
+ Confirm OS X and Solaris functionality.
+ Add usage instructions to README file for fcpget, fcpput, fcpputsite.
+ Confirm KSK, SSK, and CHK logic is all sound. Initial tests (on Linux) look good.

-----------------
ezFCPlib specific

+ Implement Key Retrival code (currently only code for inserting).
+ Implement metadata handling for FEC encoded files (specifically in ./ezFCPlib/_fcpPut.c:fec_make_metadata()).
+ Check all internal APIs for consistant usage and funcionality.
+ Handle HighestSeenBuild from NodeHello message.
+ Make fcpLog() work with files as well as standard output.
+ Implement SkipDS logic.
+ Add logic for processing Info.Format and Info.Description metadata key/val pairs.
= Add keygen code.
+ Implement CheckBlockOffset and DataBlockOffset in handling of fec segment headers.
  (it's causing the java.lang.NumberFormatException messages in the log).

------
fcpput

= Implement -g command-line switch (GenerateKeypair).
+ Optimize main()'s speed read from standard input.

------
fcpget

(Under re-write)

----------
fcpputsite

(Under re-write).
