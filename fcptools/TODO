This file's purpose is to provide a breakdown of important features/fixes
that can be implemented by any competent C programmer.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
FCPtools generic

* Add FEC support rather than straight splitfiles (option).
* Update documentation on all exported APIs (from ezFCPlib).
* Work towards OS X and Solaris platform support.
* Improve meta handling, and spotty metadata implementation.
* Add usage instructions to README file for fcpget, fcpput, fcpputsite.
* Streamline log messages, and stray printf's (perhaps in ezFCPlib).

* Prune ezfcplib.h extern function defines and co-ordinate.
* Verify fcpPutKeyFromFile works properly via fcpput.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ezFCPlib specific

* Make fcpOpenKey() handle splitfiles.
* In fcpPutSplit(), move splitfile thread handling up a layer so it dosn't
	confilict with putsite.
* Check all internal APIs for consistant usage and funcionality.
	(cdocGetDoc() is an example, in that the documented behavior is different
	from it's actual implementaion.
* Update core FCP request and response parsing.
* Implement HighestSeenBuild optional param from NodeHello message.
* Verify opentemp() in _fcpUtil.c works correctly with POSIX macros on all
  platforms.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
fcpget

* Implement DBR regression support.
* Make retries configurable.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
fcpput

* Fix bug when inserting to another Node via -n and -p parameters.
  (Perhaps fixed; seemed my remote node was misconfigured - Jay)
* Fix insert attempt counter (it reaches the undefined 4 out of 3).


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
fcpputsite

* Handle large manifests more intelligently.
* WIN32 code for checking for file changes.
* WIN32 tempfiles.
