# INSTALL file for pyFreenet,
# by David McNab <david@freenet.org.nz>
# 11 Feb, 2003
# Updated 30 Oct, 2003
# 
# 
# INTRODUCTION
# ------------
# 
# To install this software, you'll need a Python environment,
# preferably 2.2 or later, with distutils installed.
# 
# If you want to modify, debug, extend or enhance this module,
# it's best if you can install the Leo meta-structuring code
# editor - http://leo.sourceforge.net. Leo is a great editor,
# because it gives you an excellent hierarchical view of the
# code, and it now allows for seamless integration with the
# 2 'official' programmers editors, vim and [x]emacs. The
# code will be far more understandable if you view it with Leo.
# 
# Build and installation of pyfreenet is pretty similar to
# building other python modules.
# 
# 
# HOW TO AND INSTALL
# ------------------------
# 
# 1) Prerequisites:
#    You'll need the following software to be properly
#    built, installed, set up and working:
# 
#      * Access to a Freenet node - preferably your own
#      * The freenet node *must* be running over Java 1.4.1 or
#        later - otherwise you might see weird lock-ups
#      * If you're running your client code on a separate machine
#        to that on which the node is running, you must configure
#        your node to allow the FCP connections from your client machine
#      * Python 2.1 or later
#      * Python's distutils (installable on Debian as
#        'python-dev' or 'python2.x-dev')
# 
# 2) Type:
# 
# 	su -c "make install install-doc"
# 
# 3) Test your installation. Type:
# 
#     python testsuite.py
# 
#    This will run a rigorous series of tests of this API. If all
#    the tests pass, you can be quite confident that the API should
#    perform as expected.
# 
# You can find documentation for these classes in
# /usr/share/doc/pyFreenet
# 
# 
# TROUBLESHOOTING
# ---------------
# 
# Symptom:
# 
# 	$ make
# 	python setup.py build
# 	Traceback (most recent call last):
# 	File "setup.py", line 12, in ?
# 	from distutils.core import setup, Extension
# 	ImportError: No module named distutils.core
# 	make: *** [freenet_.so] Error 1
# 
# Solution:
# 
# 	You haven't got python's distutils
# 	installed. Please install python-dev
# 	package
# 
# 
# Symptom:
# 
# 	$ make install
# 	epydoc freenet.py freenet_.so
# 	make: epydoc: Command not found
# 	make: *** [doc] Error 127
# 
# Possible cause:
# 
# 	You don't seem to have epydoc (the python documentation
#     generator) installed.
# 
# Solution:
# 
# 	Install the 'epydoc' package (on debian, this is
# 	'python-epydoc').
