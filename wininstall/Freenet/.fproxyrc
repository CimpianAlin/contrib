# serverAddress points to the host:port on which you are running the Freenet node
serverAddress=127.0.0.1:19114

# Turns on and off FProxy content filtering. Some content may be
# dangerous to your anonymity. For example, if an HTML page in Freenet
# had an image embedded in it that was hosted on an HTTP server, the
# owner of that server could check everyone who had read the HTML
# page.

# The FProxy content filter attempts to warn you when a page in
# Freenet might contain threatening code. However, this is an
# experimental feature, and is NOT believed to combat ALL anonymity
# attacks. IF ANONYMITY is a HIGH PRIORITY, it is recommended that you
# not use a browser to explore Freenet. Filtering is turned off by default.
