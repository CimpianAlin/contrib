This is the Win32-EXE README file.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
FCPtools are easily installed on a Win32 platform; Windows 95/98/NT/2K.
However, they must be installed manually since there isn't currently a setup
program.  The good news; it's easy to install.

FCPtools includes 5 executables, all statically linked against ezFCPlib.

1. fcpget.exe
2. fcpproxy.exe
3. fcpput.exe
4. fcpputsite.exe
5. fcpputsplit.exe

On Windows, these programs are dynamically linked against cygwin1.dll, which
provides the UNIX emulation layer (POSIX.1 calls, etc).  The install requires
that cygwin1.dll be installed in a directory proper.

On Windows, I put it in %SYSTEMROOT%; any directory in %PATH% should work
equally well.  You'll know if it doesn't work right away :)
