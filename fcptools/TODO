This is the TODO file for FCPtools.


This file's purpose is to provide a breakdown of important features/fixes that
can be implemented by any competent C programmer.  If why a particular feature
needs implementaion is left a mystery, it's because long winded explanations
are not meant for this TODO file, otherwise I'd call it the TODO+WHY file.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
*** ezFCPlib specific *** (In order of relative importance)

- BUGFIX: fcpputsite SEGV immediately after announcing how much metadata there
is.

- Implement signal handling proper for a pthreads application.  Specifically,
it should compile *and* run on Solaris.

- Work fcpPutKeyFromFile.c away from the #WINDOWS specifics.
   (completed- joliveri)

- Confirm socket code in _fcpSock.c functions when compiled on NT/Cygwin.

- A function that accepts (char *) and returns a unique filename.  The man
page for mktemp(3) is a good example, minus the portability.
 
- Confirm file open() functions are portable and whether or not streams
should take their place (fcpOpenKey.c, ...).

- Consolidate _fcpUtil.c with other global 'FCPtools' related functions.

- Clean up _fcpRecvResponse.c (syntax, indenting scheme).  See if there can be
any code sharing.

- Determine the purpose of fcpMakeChkFromMem.c, fcpMakeChkFromFile.c.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
*** FCPtools generic ***

. Enhance command-line interface.  Add --version to all tools.
