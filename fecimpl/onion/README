README for fproxy FEC plugin, updated 20020223
giannijohansson@attbi.com

This directory contains FECEncoder and FECDecoder plugin 
implementations for fproxy.   It was written on top of the 
Onion Networks Java FEC Library v1.0.2.

See:
http://www.onionnetworks.com/components.html

for more information on Onion Networks.

DEPLOYING:
This plugin implementation and the Onion Networks FEC code is
now built in to freenet-ext.jar by default.  You shouldn't
have to add any additional jars to your CLASSPATH.  

The installer for freenet should have added the necessary
lines to you freenet.ini/conf file to make fproxy load
this plugin.

If you're having trouble check that the following lines
are in your freenet.ini/conf file.

<---snip--->
fproxy.params.FECDecoder_0_name=OnionDecoder_0
fproxy.params.FECDecoder_0_class=OnionFECDecoder

fproxy.params.FECEncoder_0_name=default_encoder
fproxy.params.FECEncoder_0_class=OnionFECEncoder

fproxy.params.FECEncoder_1_name=OnionEncoder_0
fproxy.params.FECEncoder_1_class=OnionFECEncoder

# Set this to point to a dir with a lot of free
# free space on your system.
# fproxy.params.tempDir=/usr3/fproxy_tmp

NATIVE CODE:
I disabled native code support by default.  If you
want to configure native code support, get the Onion Networks
Java FEC Library v1.0.2 zip:

http://www.onionnetworks.com/fec/fec-1.0.2.zip

Install the correct native libraries and JNI support jars
for your system.

Then use the classes NativeOnionFECDecoder and NativeOnionFECEncoder
in your Freenet initialization files.

e.g.:
fproxy.params.FECDecoder_0_name=OnionDecoder_0
fproxy.params.FECDecoder_0_class=NativeOnionFECDecoder

instead of:
fproxy.params.FECDecoder_0_name=OnionDecoder_0
fproxy.params.FECDecoder_0_class=OnionFECDecoder


BUILDING:
This code is built with a standard GNU Makefile. 
If you are in a non-*nix environment, then you're
on your own. 

Edit the FREENET_CP line in Makefile if nescessary to point to
your Freenet classes. Then from this directory, type:

make jar

to build.
