INSTALL file for pyFreenet,
by David McNab <david@freenet.org.nz>
11 Feb, 2003


INTRODUCTION
------------

To install this software, you'll need a Python environment,
preferably 2.2 or later, with distutils installed.

If you want to modify, debug, extend or enhance this module,
it's best if you can install the Leo meta-structuring code
editor - http://leo.sourceforge.net. Leo is a great editor,
because it gives you an excellent hierarchical view of the
code, and it now allows for seamless integration with the
2 'official' programmers editors, vim and [x]emacs. The
code will be far more understandable if you view it with Leo.

Build and installation of pyfreenet is pretty similar to
building other python modules.


HOW TO AND INSTALL
------------------------

1) Prerequisites:
   You'll need the following software to be properly
   built, installed, set up and working:

     * Access to a Freenet node - preferably your own
     * Python 2.1 or later
     * Python's distutils (installable on Debian as
       'python-dev' or 'python2.x-dev')

3) Type:

	  su -c "make install install-doc"


Also, you'll find documentation for these classes in
/usr/share/doc/pyFreenet


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

Symptom:

	$ make
	python setup.py build
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	File "setup.py", line 12, in ?
	from distutils.core import setup, Extension
	ImportError: No module named distutils.core
	make: *** [freenet_.so] Error 1

Solution:

	You haven't got python's distutils
	installed. Please install python-dev
	package


Symptom:

	$ make install
	epydoc freenet.py freenet_.so
	make: epydoc: Command not found

Possible cause:

    generator) installed.

Solution:

	Install the 'epydoc' package (on debian, this is
	'python-epydoc').
