This source package builds four Freenet FCP components; fcpproxy, fcpget,
fcpput and ezFCPlib.

- fcpputsite is a command-line freesite insertion client - fast and easy.

- fcpproxy is a handy http proxy server and forms an ideal fproxy replacement.

- fcpget is a command-line request client, completely based on FCP.

- fcpput is a command-line insert client, completely based on FCP.

- ezFCPlib is an easy FCP library. It is unique in that it doesn't require
  any third party libraries (as do many of the other Freenet client libs).

This is a work in progress.

The aim of FCPtools is to offer a truly multi-platform set of FCP tools,
to assist with writing Freenet client programs in C/C++.

While still in development, the tools have successfully compiled and run on:
* Windows native (compiling with MS Visual C++)
* Windows with Cygwin
* Linux
* FreeBSD 4
* NetBSD

-------------------------------------------------
Building the tools
-------------------------------------------------

1. Unix:

To compile the FCPtools on any system that can run GNU bash (which should
include all the various Unices, as well as Windows running Cygwin):

   * Type './configure'

   * Running 'configure' takes awhile.  Try './configure --help' for
     further options.

   * Type 'make' to compile the tools.

   * Optionally, type 'make check' to run any self-tests.

   * Type 'make install' to install the programs, data files and
     documentation.

   * Type 'make clean' to start a fresh build.

2. Windows:

You can either install the Cygwin package and follow the same instructions
for Unix, or use the hand-crafted makefile.

To use a makefile other than the default 'Makefile':

   * Type 'make -f Makefile.manual'.

Finally, you can open the fcptools.dsw workspace file in MS Visual C++, and
build each of the projects.

-------------------------------------------------
ezFCPlib - the easiest multi-platform FCP library
-------------------------------------------------

1. Features:

Writing Freenet client programs in C/C++ has never been easier.
This API offers two levels of Freenet access - file/memory level, and
stream level.
Read the spec in ezfcplib/doc/spec.html for more info.


-------------------------------------
'fcpproxy' - the FreeWeb Proxy Server.
-------------------------------------

1. Features:

* FProxy replacement
* generic http proxy
* FreeWeb gateway

This proxy is evolving towards a complete FCP-based replacement of
fproxy, with the FreeWeb browsing features built-in.

You can point your browser to this proxy permanently.
Any normal web requests go out to the mainstream web, while
fproxy-style and freeweb-style requests go to Freenet.


2. Running:

As you can see in main.c, this proxy listens on port 8888.

If you want, you can edit your .freenetrc file, change the
fproxy listening port to something else, and set fcpproxy to
listen on 8081. That way, any links explicitly using
'http://127.0.0.1:8081/whatever' will work ok.

Also, you'll need to make a directory /usr/share/fcpproxy, and
copy there the file gateway.html


-------------------------------------------------------
fcpget - a simple FCP-based command line request client
-------------------------------------------------------

While originally intended as a demo of the ezFCPlib library, this
is rapidly evolving into a full-featured request client.
