This source package builds four Freenet FCP components:

* ezFCPlib:    ANSI-C Freenet client library.  It is unique in that it doesn't
               require any third party libraries (as do many of the other
               Freenet client libs.

* fcpget:      command-line freenet request, based on FCP.

* fcpput:      command-line freenet insert, based on FCP.

* fcpputsite:  command-line freesite insertion client - fast and easy.

* fcpproxy:    http proxy server; an fproxy replacement.

(Set favorite editor's tabstop to 2 for best results)

This is a work in progress.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The aim of FCPtools is to offer a truly multi-platform ANSI-C based Freenet
client library, as well as provide command-line tools for convenience and
potentially shell scripting.

While still in development, the tools have successfully compiled and run on:
* Windows 2K/Cygwin (confirmed)
* Windows 98/Cygwin (confirm?)
* BSD (Free and Net) (confirmed)
* Linux (confirmed)
* Solaris (pending)

FCPtools no longer compiles within the MS Visual C++ environment.  To provide
true portability, one must move away from the company notorious for being
against it.</opinion>


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Building the tools
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Unix (general)

To compile the FCPtools on any system that can run GNU bash (which should
include all the various Unices, as well as Windows/Cygwin):

* Type './configure'

* Running 'configure' takes awhile.  Try './configure --help' for
  further options.

* Type 'make' to compile the tools.

* Optionally, type 'make check' to run any self-tests.

* Type 'make install' to install the programs, data files and
  documentation.

* Type 'make clean' to start a fresh build.

2. Solaris

Same as Unix, but substitute 'gmake' for 'make'


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ezFCPlib - the easiest multi-platform FCP library
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Writing Freenet client programs in C/C++ has never been easier.

This API offers two levels of Freenet access:

* File/Memory.
* Streams.

Read the spec in ezfcplib/doc/spec.html for more info.

fcpproxy - http proxy
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Features:

* FProxy replacement.
* Generic http proxy.

This proxy is evolving towards a complete FCP-based replacement of fproxy, with
the FreeWeb browsing features built-in.

You can point your browser to this proxy permanently. Any normal web requests
go out to the mainstream web, while fproxy-style and freeweb-style requests
go to Freenet.

2. Running:

Fcpproxy listens on port 8888.

If you want, you can edit your .freenetrc file, change the fproxy listening
port to something else, and set fcpproxy to listen on 8081. That way, any links
explicitly using 'http://127.0.0.1:8081/whatever' will work ok.

Also, you'll need to make a directory /usr/share/fcpproxy, and copy there the
file gateway.html
