== Split, refer to external project ==

[bdb]
contrib version: 3.3.69
debian package: libdb-je-java
debian version: 3.3.62
debian jar: /usr/share/java/db-je.jar
notes: debian has newer versions called libdb4.[5678]-java

[db4o]
contrib version: 7.4.63.11890
notes: apparently very very painful to upgrade to newer version due to API changes

[wrapper]
contrib version: 3.3.5
debian package: service-wrapper-java
debian version: 3.5.3 (new)

[java.apache.tools]
debian package: ant
debian version: 1.8.0
debian jar: /usr/share/java/ant.jar
notes: different, possibly newer, version called commons-compress;
       needs API modifications, but is much easier to bundle.

== Split, mirror source code ourselves ==

[java.lzma]
http://contrapunctus.net/
TODO: need to ask toad why there are two of these...

[java.sevenzip]
aka. java_lzma
http://p7zip.sourceforge.net/

[java.mantissa]

== Keep ==

These packages seem to be used ONLY in freenet and pretty much no-where else.
Not worth it to split them into their own packages.

[fec] - currently has a segfault issue and is disabled
[jcpuid]
[NativeBigInteger] - can possibly drop in favour of BigInteger which is fast enough now due to JIT
[NativeThread]
