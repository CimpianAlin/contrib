This is the TODO file for FCPtools.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Need to streamline the check for pthreads (POSIX.1, perhaps a later version if
CygWin supports it) done during automake.


Complete all modifications necessary for true portability among UNIX-like
environments.  This includes:

* fcpOpenKey.c:
* fcpWriteKey.c:
* fcpGetKeyToFile.c:
* fcpPutKeyFromFile.c:

* _fcpPutSplit.c:
* metaParse.c:


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Non-port specific tasks:

* Add command line param '--version'.
* Pretty up the command line info screens.
