This is the TODO file for FCPtools.

Need to streamline the check for pthreads (POSIX.1 in general) done during
automake.

Complete all modifications necessary for true portability among UNIX-like
environments.  This includes:

* fcpStartup.c:ftpStartup() - TMP file management.
* fcpOpenKey.c:
* fcpWriteKey.c:
* fcpCloseKey.c:fcpCloseKeyWrite() - TMP file management
* fcpGetKeyToFile.c:
* fcpPutKeyFromFile.c:
* _fcpSock.c: - Remove Win32 specific socket calls.
* _fcpPutSplit.c:
* metaParse.c: (?)
