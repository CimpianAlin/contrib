How to build installers for "Freenet for Windows"
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Any questions? mailto:dave@rebuzz.org

Tools required
==============

1) NSIS, the free Nullsoft installer.
	http://nsis.sourceforge.net/
	You should use NSIS 2

2) UPX (for windows, even if you already have it for cygwin)
	http://upx.sourceforge.net/

Make sure makensis.exe and upx.exe are in your %PATH%


Freenet software
================

The webinstaller does very little other than show a GUI while it downloads the freenet
executables and .jar files and other bits and pieces from http://freenetproject.org

So there are no additional files required to build the installer (assuming you've already
checked out the whole wininstall project from CVS - if you have this file, you probably did!)


Building the installer
=====================

Run build.bat from the Contrib/wininstall directory
It currently builds just freenet-webinstall.exe
