This is a full redistributable Java Runtime Environment, created in accordance to the
Sun license conditions for JRE redistribution.

All optional files and directories have been omitted, and
all required files and directories are present.

This JRE tree prepared by David McNab, April 2001, from the Sun standard distribution.

Also included in this runtime is the bin/classic/jvm.dll file, which allows C programs
using JNI to communicate with the Freenet java classes.

The Freenet project and its developers fully honour Sun's license conditions, and thank
Sun Inc for making their Java Runtime available for embedding in third party software
installers.

However, should a licensing issue arise, please contact the Freenet developers at
devl@freenetproject.org. Any legitimate concerns will be promptly rectified.
