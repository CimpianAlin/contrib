BEFORE RUNNING:

Saturn requires that the NNTPSERVER environment variable be set to your 
USENET server.  If you haven't got a USENET server, you will need one.    
Check the docs that your ISP sent you, or phone their tech support.
Alternatively find a public Usenet server, although be warned - these are
increasingly rare.  You should add a line such as:

export NNTPSERVER=my.nntp.server

To your .bashrc or /etc/profile and restart your shell.  Alternatively, 
you can launch saturn as follows:

NNTPSERVER=my.nntp.server saturn xxx

OTHER NOTES:

If FCP is running on a port other than 8082 (the default) you must add 
this line to your /etc/services file:

fcp             XXXX/tcp                        # Freenet Client Protocol

Where XXXX is the port on which FCP is running.
