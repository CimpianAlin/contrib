fcptools and consequently ezFCPlib do not currently execute on Solaris.

POSIX Threads (pthreads) are great for multi-threaded applcations that need
to be portable across UNIX/MS boundaries.  The handling of signals in these
kinds of applications must be carefully done.  The following are verbatim
quotes dealing with solutions from Usenet:

"Use sigwait() in a seperate thread to handle undirected signals.
Directed signals should be handled by the individual threads."
-- Bjorn Reese; 1997/07/21; comp.programming.threads

The fact that this quote is dated 1997 should indicate the situation is not
likely to change on it's own.
