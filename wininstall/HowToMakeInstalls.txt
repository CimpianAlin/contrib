How to prepare a self installing package of "Freenet for Windows"
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Any questions? mailto:Sebastian@SSpaeth.de

How to make an install
======================
1)Get the free Nullsoft installer (NSIS) at http://nullsoft.com/free/NSIS 
  (I won't provide it here for disc space reasons)
2)Take the Freenet subdirectory and add the current files:
  freenet.jar, updated .fproxyrc and freenet.ini
  (make sure the entry listenPort= in freenet.ini exists, but no value is entered yet,
  otherwise this one will be used in all installs)
2a)Create a Subdirectory of Freenet called "IEplugin" and put IEFreenetPlugin.dll for the IE plugin in there.
3)Duplicate fserve.exe in the same directory as files: frequest.exe, finsert.exe and fproxy.exe
4)Configure freenet.nsi to contain the correct version numbers and exe name on all appearances
5)Call "makensis freenet"
6)Test install AND LET OTHER PEOPLE INSTALL AS WELL, bugs often appear only with special 
  configurations (Java Runtime, Win version, Path names,...)


ToDo list (Help appreciated)
============================
Browser plugins:
IEplugin:
 - Test if automatic install functions!
Mozilla plugin:
 - Either include browser plugins in the install or pop up a text file, telling how to
   install them
 - Add instructions about how to change the port number.
Java source:
 - Make scripts.Setup.java so that it can silently create a freenet.ini with all defaults

 - turn off bandwidth throttling by default?
 - Write a better help file / manual / starter in a nice format (Windows help or html)
Cfgclient:
 - on multiple runs it appends the node port several times, preventing FProxy to start up
   (fixed?)
FindJava.exe:
 - Rename Cancel button to "Abort" (best to cancel whole installation!)
 - Put the window in Front once it is pops up the search done alert.
Bugs:
 - Configure doesn't work with jview.exe but with javaw.exe
