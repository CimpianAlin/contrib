This is a simple "wrapper" for the real 0.7 installer, produced by request
of NextGen$.
It is intended for windows users who (think they) don't have Java installed.
It tries to find Java Web Start, and if it cannot installs the bundled JRE 
(currently jre-1_5_0_06-windows-i586-p.exe). Then it invokes the 'real'
installer via its JNLP.

Built version : /trunk/win32-bin/freenet-pre-07-alpha.exe
