This file's purpose is to provide a breakdown of important features/fixes
that can be implemented by any competent C programmer.

+ means todo
= means done
- means on hold


----------------
FCPtools generic
----------------

+ Confirm OS X functionality.
+ Confirm *BSD functionality.
+ Confirm Solaris functionality.

+ Add usage instructions to README for fcpget, fcpputsite.
+ Implement future_insert(num_days) option.
+ Verify other options (raw, etc.) work as expected.

+ Implement an insertion/retrieval scheduler layer; directly above the fcpWriteKey() and fcpPutKeyFromFile() routines.
  (Most useful to a future fcpputsite program).
  Would provide the following functionality as well:
  + Retry option; attempt again (due to error or Restarted message) to insert or retrieve the named key.  After 'n' retries, return with error.
  + Insert thread count; maximum number of non-FEC insert threads; make FEC insert thread count hardcoded to 1.
  + FEC_insert thread count; should treat these 2 threading situations differently for some reason.


-----------------
ezFCPlib specific
-----------------

+ Improve upon temp file and log file locations.
+ Update ezFCPlib programming API documentation.
+ Implement Key Retrieval code (currently only code for inserting).
+ Implement metadata handling for FEC encoded files (specifically in ./ezFCPlib/_fcpPut.c:fec_make_metadata()).
+ Implement SkipDS logic.
+ Check all internal APIs for consistant usage and funcionality.
+ Add logic for processing Info.Format and Info.Description metadata key/val pairs.
+ Implement retry logic, so that ezFCPlib attempts to insert _fcpRetry times on failed message.
+ Correct Restarted message handling to ensure seamless restarts.
  (_fcpPut.c:266, _fcpPut.c:915, _fcpPut.c:1105, _fcpPut.c:1220).
+ Ignore DataChunks between Restarted and DataFound messages (from freenet-dev).
+ Make hDocument->data field dynamic.
+ Warn user if HighestSeenBuild is higher than current node's build; and option to disable warning.
+ Improve the splitfile size ceiling; the node uses one, the tools use another(?)

- Make FEC_CHUNK_SIZE configurable; default to 1M (Fred computes this afaik).
- Add logic like fcpTmpDir for an 'fcpHomeDir'; /home/$user on nix, %USERPROFILE%\My Documents for Win32.
  (still undecided)

= #define HFCP to hFCP to ease transition. (not necessary)
= Remove global variables in _fcpGlobals.c.  Make them private. (all that remains are read-only).
= Make fcpLog() work with files as well as standard output.
= Implement DeleteDS logic (delete-local or RemoveLocalKey).
= Add keygen code.
= Add fcphello command to just send ClientHello to node (ft-0.2).
= Handle HighestSeenBuild from NodeHello message.
= Solidify TEMP directory setting for all architectures. (fcpStartup.c)
  (Check _fcpCompat.c:_fcpTmpfile()) - could be improved upon (see above note).
= Code a seperate fcpNodeHello function. (fcpSendHello()).
= Implement CheckBlockOffset and DataBlockOffset in handling of fec segment headers.
  (it's causing the java.lang.NumberFormatException messages in Fred's log).


------
fcpput
------

+ Optimize main()'s speed read from standard input.
+ (Win32); returns to command prompt with (harmless) error when reading key data from stdin.

= Implement -g command-line switch (GenerateKeypair).


----------
fcpputsite
----------

+ Re-link againt ezFCPlib and implement site-wide specific insert logic.
+ Implement Edition based logic.
+ Verify current DRB logic.
+ Implement do_dbr option.
+ Implement default_doc option (defaults to index.html).


------
fcpget
------

+ Do.
