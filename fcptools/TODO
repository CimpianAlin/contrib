This file's purpose is to provide a breakdown of important features/fixes
that can be implemented by any competent C programmer.

+ means todo
= means done


----------------
FCPtools generic
----------------

+ Update ezFCPlib documentation.

+ Confirm OS X functionality.
+ Confirm *BSD functionality.
+ Confirm Solaris functionality.

+ Add usage instructions to README for fcpget, fcpputsite.


-----------------
ezFCPlib specific
-----------------

+ Implement Key Retrival code (currently only code for inserting).
+ Implement metadata handling for FEC encoded files (specifically in ./ezFCPlib/_fcpPut.c:fec_make_metadata()).
+ Check all internal APIs for consistant usage and funcionality.
+ Handle HighestSeenBuild from NodeHello message.
+ Make fcpLog() work with files as well as standard output.
+ Implement SkipDS logic.
+ Implement DeleteDS logic.
+ Add logic for processing Info.Format and Info.Description metadata key/val pairs.
= Add keygen code.
+ Implement CheckBlockOffset and DataBlockOffset in handling of fec segment headers.
  (it's causing the java.lang.NumberFormatException messages in Fred's log).
+ #define HFCP to hFCP to ease transition.
+ Decide which global vars should be handled by CreateHFCP and which need setter functions for modification
  (not acceptable that ezFCPlib needs to be loaded in order to change configuration parameters).
+ Implement retry logic, so that ezFCPlib attempts to insert _fcpRetry times on failed message.

fcpput

= Implement -g command-line switch (GenerateKeypair).
+ Optimize main()'s speed read from standard input.
+ (Win32); returns to command prompt with (harmless) error when reading key data from stdin.
