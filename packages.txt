== Overview ==

contrib contains the following libraries:

Upstream source
:	The build scripts will download these from the upstream project. These are
	well-known  and most OS distributions should have them in their package
	repository.

	- bdb
	- db4o
	- wrapper
	- commons-compress

Mirrored source
:	The build scripts will download these from the freenet servers, but they
	have not been modified from upstream. These projects are smaller, and are
	unlikely to have been packaged by an OS distribution.

	- lzma
	- SevenZip
	- mantissa

Locally maintained
:	These sources for these are included here in the repo, and we maintain it
	ourselves, because the original projects are no longer actively maintained.

	- jcpuid
	- NativeBigInteger
	- NativeThread
	- onion-common
	- onion-fec

== Building ==

The contrib build script will retrieve each of the source packages and build
them. It will then build all the locally-maintained packages, and collect them
into freenet-ext.jar.

[onion-common]

Version 20020926 was imported into contrib on 2006-11-10. You can verify that
this was a clean import by running:

  $ unzip fec-1.0.3/common-20020926.zip common-20020926/*
  $ git checkout 3ebd55031d69ebfd129a83e2433b6fcc20e88b6c fec/common
  $ diff -ru common-20020926 fec/common
  Only in common-20020926: classes
  Only in common-20020926: javadoc
  Only in common-20020926: lib
  [snip]
  $ rm -rf fec/common && git reset --hard HEAD

where fec-1.0.3 is where you extracted Onion FEC 1.0.3.

You can view the changes made since this time, by running

  $ git log -M -- fec/common
