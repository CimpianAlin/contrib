This file's purpose is to provide a breakdown of important features/fixes
that can be implemented by any competent C programmer.

+ means todo
= means done
- means on hold


----------------
General
----------------

+ KSK's do/don't support CryptoKey?
+ Remove the POSIX dependancy (ugh).
+ Add -ansi for linux platform (development) and restrict everywhere else.
+ Make sure the "undocumented" switches are documented at least in fcpput, fcpget, etc.

= Add support for DateRedirect/increment parameter
= Write code to insert DBR root and target in same execution (using a 'future insert' option).
= After Pending, reset the Retry count.
= fcpput thinks -D option is passed on inserting splitfiles(?)
= Fix spelling in _fcpRecvResponse.c: "Received RoutNotFound message"
= Implement future_insert(num_days) option (along with *both* DBR root and target keys).


-----------------
ezFCPlib
-----------------

General:
+ Implement anonymity filtering.
+ Implement charset & mimetype handling.
+ Clean up Verbose log messages; verify *all* command line options are re-iterated.
+ Add logic for processing Info.Format and Info.Description metadata key/val pairs.
+ Make hDocument->data & hMetadata->cdocs fields dynamic.
+ Warn user if HighestSeenBuild is higher than current node's build; and option to disable warning.

= Append the filename to the filename-hint section of the returned URI for CHK's.
= fcpParseHURI() is now crazy redundant; prune some of the replicated code and make it more generic
	(instead of separating into 3 sections; KSK, SSK, CHK)
= Verify handling of CryptoKey in key generation.
= Implement CryptoKey handling for CHK's in fcpParseHURI().
= Add configuration option for Timeout length (added a MinTimeout value).
= Move READFILE WRITEFILE flags from ez_sys to ezFCPlib.h
= Handle "BackedOff" field in RouteNotFound response.
= Verify current DBR logic.
= Implement do_dbr option.
= Implement logic to read in <rest> section for custom metadata (_fcpMetadata.c).

Put:

Get:
+ Implement charset & mimetype handling.

= Handle the following query parameters(some; not all): rdate, verbose, key, force, try, htl, linkhtl, maxlogsize, mime,
date.

------
fcpput
------


----------
fcpputsite
----------

+ Re-link againt ezFCPlib and implement site-wide specific insert logic.
+ Implement Edition based logic.
+ Implement default_doc option (defaults to index.html).


------
fcpget
------

+ Start w/ _fcpGet.c:_fcpGetBlock()
+ Implement FEC Splitfile handling for _fcpGet.c.
+ On getFollowRedirects, must save metadata for the case where a redirect takes
	the client to another key; currently we're dropping the metadata.
+ Implement regress for _fcpGet.c.
+ Implement metadata handling for FEC encoded files.

= Read metadata (if any) via fcpReadMetadata()
= Write metadata to the right place when -s is used
  (it currently dumps to stdout.. desirable?)
