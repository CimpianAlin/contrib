This is the TODO file for FCPtools.


This file's purpose is to provide a breakdown of important features/fixes that
can be implemented by any competent C programmer.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
*** ezFCPlib specific *** (In order of relative importance)

- A function that accepts (char *) and returns a unique filename.  The man
page for mktemp(3) is a good example, minus the portability.
 
- Confirm file open() functions are portable and whether or not streams
should take their place (fcpOpenKey.c, ...).

- Consolidate _fcpUtil.c with other global 'FCPtools' related functions.

- Clean up _fcpRecvResponse.c (syntax, indenting scheme).  See if there can be
any code sharing.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
*** FCPtools generic ***

- Enhance command-line interface.  Add version number to all help screens
  (done for fcpget; todo for fcpput*).
