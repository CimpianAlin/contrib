This source package builds four Freenet FCP components:

* ezFCPlib:    ANSI-C Freenet client library.  It is unique in that it doesn't
               require any third party libraries (as do many of the other
               Freenet client libs.

* fcpget:      command-line freenet request, based on FCP.

* fcpput:      command-line freenet insert, based on FCP.

* fcpputsite:  command-line freesite insertion client - fast and easy.

* fcpproxy:    http proxy server; an fproxy replacement.

(Set favorite editor's tabstop to 2 for best results)

This is a work in progress.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The aim of FCPtools is to offer a truly multi-platform ANSI-C based Freenet
client library, as well as provide command-line tools for convenience and
potentially shell scripting.

While still in development, the tools have successfully compiled and run on:
* Windows 2000/Microsoft Visual C++  6.0
* (confirmation from Win98/95 users?)
* FreeBSD & NetBSD
* GNU/Linux


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Building the tools
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Unix (general)

To compile the FCPtools on any system that can run GNU bash (which should
include all the various Unices, as well as Windows/Cygwin):

* Type './configure'

* Running 'configure' takes awhile.  Try './configure --help' for
  further options.

* Type 'make' to compile the tools.

* Optionally, type 'make check' to run any self-tests.

* Type 'make install' to install the programs, data files and
  documentation.

* Type 'make clean' to start a fresh build.


2. Solaris

Same as Unix, but substitute 'gmake' for 'make'


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ezFCPlib - An easy, multi-platform FCP library
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

ezFCPlib aims to be a portable, multi-platform client library for programmers
who want to write Freenet capable clients without learning the details of
Freenet itself.  It also minimizes the "ripple effect" from changes in the
Node source, which is important at this stage in Freenet's life.

The API provides client writers:

* Functions to create Freenet keys and keypairs.
* High level reading/writing of Freenet data.
* Lower level reading/writing via filestreams.
* Various utility functions.

While parts of the spec are out of date, the functions and their signatures
have remained the same.  You can find it relative to this directory at:
