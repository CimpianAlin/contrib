# 
# pyFreenet is a Python package for accessing the Freenet
# network.
# 
# In case you don't already know, Freenet is a network
# infrastructure, running over the top of the regular
# internet, which allows you to publish and access
# materials with extremely high levels of anonymity,
# privacy and encryption.
# 
# Freenet is the world-leading technology for preserving
# the rights of the individual against the whims of
# increasingly draconian governments around the world.
# 
# Visit the Freenet website at:
# http://www.freenetproject.org
# for more info and downloads.
# 
# With pyFreenet, you can access everything in freenet
# from your own python programs. Once pyFreenet is installed,
# all you need to do from your python code is:
# 
#   import freenet
# 
# then, use the methods in module 'freenet' to do whatever
# you want to do.
# 
# Refer to the doco in the doc subdirectory for detailed
# descriptions of the classes and methods.
