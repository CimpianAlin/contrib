How to prepare a self installing package of "Freenet for Windows"
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Any questions? mailto:Sebastian@SSpaeth.de

How to make an install
======================
1)Get the free Nullsoft installer (NSIS) at http://nullsoft.com/free/NSIS 
  (I won't provide it here for disc space reasons)
2)Take the Freenet subdirectory and add the current files:
  freenet.jar, updated .fproxyrc and freenet.ini
  (make sure the entry listenPort= in freenet.ini exists, but no value is entered yet,
  otherwise this one will be used in all installs)
3)Duplicate fserv.exe in the same directory as files: frequest.exe, finsert.exe and fproxy.exe
4)Configure freenet.nsi to contain the correct version numbers and exe name on all appearances
5)Call "makensis freenet"

Remarks
=======
 -To add the plugin support there will be subdirectories in the Freenet directory,
  but that's not ready yet.
 -I don't update CVS too often, you might have to remind me to do so once in a while

ToDo list (Help appreciated)
=========
 - Integrate browser plugins in install, and make installation easy
 - Make scripts.Setup.java so that it can silently create a freenet.ini with all defaults
 - turn off bandwidth throttling by default?
 - Write a better help file / manual / starter in a nice format (Windows help or html)

Reminder to myself: I need to put the source of JavaFind into CVS as well!
