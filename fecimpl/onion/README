README for onionfec-0.1.jar, updated 20011104
giannijohansson@mediaone.net

This directory contains FECEncoder and FECDecoder plugin 
implementations for fproxy.   It was written on top of the 
Onion Networks Java FEC Library v1.0.2.

See:
http://www.onionnetworks.com/components.html

for more information on Onion Networks.

See the file onion_LICENSE for licensing information for
the Onion Networks code.

DEPLOYING:
Make sure onionfec-0.1.jar, fec.jar and common.jar are in
your CLASSPATH.

Then add the following fragment to your freenet
initialization file (freenet.conf or freenet.ini)
if it isn't already there.

<---snip--->
fproxy.FECDecoder_0_name=OnionDecoder_0
fproxy.FECDecoder_0_class=OnionFECDecoder

fproxy.FECEncoder_0_name=default_encoder
fproxy.FECEncoder_0_class=OnionFECEncoder

fproxy.FECEncoder_1_name=OnionEncoder_0
fproxy.FECEncoder_1_class=OnionFECEncoder
<---snip--->

When you restart fproxy, the encoder and decoder
implementations should be available.

NATIVE CODE:
I disabled native code support by default.  If you
want to configure native code support, get the Onion Networks
Java FEC Library v1.0.2 zip:

http://www.onionnetworks.com/fec/fec-1.0.2.zip

Install the correct native libraries and JNI support jars
for your system.

Then use the classes NativeOnionFECDecoder and NativeOnionFECEncoder
in your Freenet initialization files.

e.g.:
fproxy.FECDecoder_0_name=OnionDecoder_0
fproxy.FECDecoder_0_class=NativeOnionFECDecoder

instead of:
fproxy.FECDecoder_0_name=OnionDecoder_0
fproxy.FECDecoder_0_class=OnionFECDecoder


BUILDING:
This code is built with a standard GNU Makefile. 
If you are in a non-*nix environment, then you're
on your own. 

Edit the FREENET_CP line in Makefile if nescessary to point to
your Freenet classes. Then from this directory, type:

make jar

to build the onionfec-0.1.jar jar file.

DISCLAIMER:
This code wasn't written by Onion Networks. It isn't endorsed or 
supported by them.
