Quickstart for FProxy
=====================

NOTE: FProxy works still less reliable than the console clients. If you are having trouble 
      with it, please use these first to make sure it is no Freenet problem. 

1)FProxy will be automatically started with the system tray utility by default. (or start 
  FProxy.exe if you are not using the system tray utility)

2)Open the gateway page by choosing "Open Gateway" in the system tray utility (or open
  http://localhost:8081 in a webbrowser) The gateway page should appear, if you don't get a
  page please look at the Troubleshhoting section ("The gateway page doesn't appear").

3)Assuming you see the gateway page, use the request and insert fields to specify the key 
  you want to insert/retrieve from Freenet. Think of the key as the location of files in 
  Freenet. (Just like the http:// address of a website)

5)Have patience! Inserting or retrieving can easily take up to 5 minutes. Especially when it
  says 'state "REQUESTING" reached' it will take quite a while.


Browser plugins
===============
If you want to enable your browser to use URIs of the format "freenet:<key>" (that is most probably the way freenet URI will be linked to on web pages in the future) you'll need a browser plugin.
Note: Browser plugins are not yet included!

Mozilla/NS6:
For Netscape6 and Mozilla based browsers there's a GNU GPL/MPL licensed cool tool available at
http://protozilla.mozdev.org/ that does it. We provide it optionally during installation.
For updates, licensing information and more information have a look at their web site.

Internet Explorer:
There exists a IE plugin that does the same for IE. An implementation is included in current
installers. For feedback contact the developer mailto:freenet@hug.cx.


Tips for requesting
===================
Use the list of keyservers at http://uts.cc.utexas.edu/~blanu/keyindex.html to choose the 
keyserver you want to search for certain keys.


Tips for inserting
==================
Key server: If you choose one of the key server that are presented in the menu, the key you
  insert will be added to the list there. This is currently the only way to publish your
  inserted key (other by telling your key to other people by mail, IRC,...)

Troubleshooting
===============

1)The gateway page doesn't appear
  Mmmh, if you didn't mistype localhost:8081, that basically means FProxy is not running at
  all. Bad, check FProxy.log (if existing) to see what went wrong. 
  Starting with FProxy -logging debug will give you a detailed output of what happened.
  First assumption would be: You have already a program running that uses port 8081.

2)The Gateway page appeared but I couldn't retrieve/insert anything
  Boy, the worst case. _A lot_ of different things can be wrong in this case. First let's 
  make sure the backend, the Freenet node itself runs fine. Try to request or insert a key 
  via the command line client and make sure the node runs.

  OK, assumimg you did suceed requesting something via the CLI client, otherwise you are 
  fucked anyway and should fix the node first before even think of using FProxy.
  Now, lets see if your FProxy points to your node. You should have started FProxy with a
  -serverAddress <nodeIP>:<port> option. Look at the files .fproxyrc and FLaunch.ini in 
  any text editor. You should have the correct address (and port number) in the FProxy entry.


Where can I get additional help?
================================
  Try the support@freenetproject.org mailing list after searching the 
  documentation on the freenet site. You might be lucky in the #freenet channel on the
  IRC server irc.openprojects.org, sometimes some developers hang out there.
