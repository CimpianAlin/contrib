This is the TODO file for FCPtools.


This file's purpose is to provide a breakdown of important features/fixes that
can be implemented by any competent C programmer.  If why a particular feature
needs implementaion is left a mystery, it's because long winded explanations
are not meant for this TODO file, otherwise I'd call it the TODO+WHY file.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
*** ezFCPlib specific *** (In order of relative importance)

- A function that accepts (char *) and returns a unique filename.  The man
page for mktemp(3) is a good example, minus the portability.
 
- Confirm file open() functions are portable and whether or not streams
should take their place (fcpOpenKey.c, ...).

- Consolidate _fcpUtil.c with other global 'FCPtools' related functions.

- Clean up _fcpRecvResponse.c (syntax, indenting scheme).  See if there can be
any code sharing.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
*** FCPtools generic ***

- fix STDOUT parameter in fcpget

- Enhance command-line interface.  Add version number to all help screens
  (done for fcpget).

- Standardize all global-defaults (localhost/127.0.0.1, etc.)
