This is a basic reimplementation of the JUnit unit testing framework, licensed
under the GNU GPL (JUnit is, for some reason, released under the IBM Public 
License). This was just an afternoon's hack, so for real testing you
may still wish to use JUnit, but developing against this should avoid any
questions regarding licensing (since you are using the GPL, right?).

This code is written without the authorization or knowledge of the original 
JUnit authors, and bares no relation to their code short of containing the
same class, method, and field names.
